# Image Encryption
Welcome to Image Encryption Project Using AES Algorithm Implementation

## [Introduction to Cryptography](#introduction)

An image encryption project typically involves designing and implementing an algorithm that can encrypt and decrypt digital images. The project may involve the following steps:

- **Requirements gathering:** Identify the specific requirements and objectives of the image encryption project. This may involve understanding the type of images to be encrypted, the level of security required, and the intended users of the system.

- **Algorithm design:** Design an encryption algorithm that meets the requirements of the project. The algorithm should be able to convert the image data into an encrypted format using cryptographic techniques such as AES, RSA, DES, or Blowfish.

- **Implementation:** Implement the encryption algorithm in a programming language such as Python, Java, or C++. The implementation should allow users to encrypt and decrypt digital images.

- **Testing and validation:** Test the encryption algorithm using a variety of digital images to ensure that it meets the requirements of the project. Validate the results and ensure that the encrypted images can be decrypted correctly.

- **Integration:** Integrate the encryption algorithm into a larger system, such as a digital rights management system or a secure image-sharing platform.

- **Documentation:** Document the project, including the algorithm design, implementation details, testing results, and user instructions. This documentation should be clear and concise so that other developers can understand and build on the project.

- **Maintenance:** Maintain the encryption algorithm and the larger system over time, addressing any bugs or security vulnerabilities that may arise.

## [Problem Statement](#Problem)

***Image Encryption using AES algorithm:*** This project involves implementing image encryption using the AES symmetric-key encryption algorithm. The project involves designing an algorithm that converts an image to a matrix of pixels and then encrypts the matrix using the AES algorithm. The encrypted matrix can be decrypted using the same key to retrieve the original image.

***Image Encryption using RSA algorithm:*** This project involves implementing image encryption using the RSA asymmetric-key encryption algorithm. The project involves generating public and private keys, and then using the public key to encrypt the image data. The encrypted image can be decrypted using the private key to retrieve the original image.

## [Goal and Objectives](#Goal)

1. Image encryption is the process of converting an image into an unreadable format using cryptographic techniques, such as encryption algorithms and keys. The encrypted image is protected from unauthorized access, and it can be decrypted only with the correct decryption key.

2. The main objective of image encryption is to protect the confidentiality and integrity of an image by making it unreadable and unrecognizable to unauthorized parties. Image encryption aims to achieve this by using cryptographic techniques to transform the image data into an encrypted format, which can only be decrypted by someone who has the correct decryption key.
